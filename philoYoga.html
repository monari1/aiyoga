    <p style="position:absolute; font-size: 23px; width:1300px; top:200px; left:50px;">
        The Yoga Philosophy is a miraculous gift from the ancient Indian sage
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali" target="_blank">Patanjali</a> to everyone who seeks
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual)#:~:text=In%20the%20western%20world%20the,covered%20over%20by%20social%20conditioning." target="_blank">spiritual enlightenment</a>. Philosophy of Yoga is one of the <a href="https://library.acropolis.org/the-darshanas-six-schools-of-indian-philosophy/"
            target="_blank"> six primary darśanas </a> (orthodox major schools of classical Indian Philosophy) of <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/religion/hinduism#:~:text=Hinduism%20is%20the%20world's%20oldest,world's%20Hindus%20live%20in%20India."
            target="_blank">Hinduism</a>. It is a tremendous help to individuals who want to understand the existence of the spirit as an independent principle free of the limits of the body, senses, and mind, which is known as the Patanjala system.<br>
        <br> Yoga's main philosophy is straightforward: mind, body, and spirit are interlinked and cannot be separated. Yoga is a combination of
        <a href="https://isha.sadhguru.org/yoga/yoga-articles-hatha-yoga-asanas/asanas-guide/" target="_blank">physical Posture (āsana)</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUUgRpEC7fY&ab_channel=TheYogaInstitute" target="_blank">meditation (Dhyāna)</a>,
        <a href="https://isha.sadhguru.org/yoga/yoga-articles-hatha-yoga-asanas/asanas-guide/" target="_blank">breathing (prāṇāyāma)</a>. Yoga Philosophy began in <a href="https://www.timemaps.com/civilizations/ancient-india/" target="_blank">ancient India</a>        perhaps in
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlONwxT9Nlc&ab_channel=Cogito" target="_blank">the Indus valley civilization</a> (in present-day Pakistan) approximately in 3000 BCE. Yoga was initially mentioned in ancient sacred texts known as the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads" target="_blank"> Upanishads</a> from the 1st Millenium BCE.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaf47zusx4&ab_channel=ArshaBodhaCenter-SwamiTadatmananda" target="_blank">The Eight Limbs of Yogic Meditation</a> or phases of yoga detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1X-ar76nA&ab_channel=VedantaNewYork"
            target="_blank">
      Patanjali's Yoga Sutras</a> are the most lasting component of this classic book of philosophy, which must be followed to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha#:~:text=Moksha%20(%2F%CB%88mo%CA%8Ak,enlightenment%2C%20liberation%2C%20and%20release."

        <br> The difference between merely going to the gym and practicing yoga is the philosophy! Yoga the philosophy provides a personal context for getting the most out of practices such as posture flow, breathing exercises, or mental meditational
        practices. And if one adopts a philosophical approach to Yoga, then all activities are limbs in support of one’s own Lordliness and mastery over life. Without <a href="https://www.yogaphilosophy.com/" target="_blank">yoga philosophy</a> , practices
        such as posture flow, or breathing exercises, can become fetishes and hindrances to one’s own Lordliness.
