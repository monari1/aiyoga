        Hey there! Welcome to A_yoga_I, developed in 2022 by Francis Monari. <br><br> I created A_yoga_I inspired by various Machine Learning models for visual recognition as Hackton Project. This is my first project with Machine Learning model and attempt
        at Web Development.
        <br> A_yoga_I is a virtual yoga trainer. It monitors your posture using Tensorflow during various yoga poses, and tells if you are doing it correctly or not. It has a button to learn so, first we can learn yoga poses within 10 seconds. After learning,
        we start doing practice poses within 30 seconds. There is another button about Philosophy of Yoga, it is a short description of it. where you can find words to click that are links to various websites, wikipedia and youtube videos. Feel free to
        watch and read <a href="philoYoga.html" target="_blank">about Philosophy of Yoga</a>, it will give you better understanding and knowledge.<br>

        <br>A_yoga_I uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview" target="_blank">Pose.Net</a>, developed by Google’s TensorFlow, and <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>, a JavaScript library for Machine
        Learning on the browser. Most of my learning was following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y" target="_blank">
    The Coding Train’s</a> YouTube playlist on Pose Estimation. <br>
